#RUN is an image build step, the state of the container after a RUN command will be committed to the container
# image. A Dockerfile can have many RUN steps that layer on top of one another to build the image
# RUN Builds a new layer over an existing image by committing the results.

# COPY copies files from a local source location to a destination in the Docker container.
# Same as 'ADD', but without the tar and remote URL handling.

# Multiple <src> resource may be specified but they must be relative to the source directory that is being built (the context of the build).
# <dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to WORKDIR, into which the source will be copied inside the destination container.
# If <src> is a directory, the entire contents of the directory are copied, including filesystem metadata. Note: The directory itself is not copied, just its contents
# If multiple <src> resources are specified, either directly or due to the use of a wildcard, then <dest> must be a directory, and it must end with a slash /.
#If <dest> does not end with a trailing slash, it will be considered a regular file and the contents of <src> will be written at <dest>.
#If <dest> doesnâ€™t exist, it is created along with all missing directories in its path.

# ADD can copy from url, and uncompress. COPY cannot. COPY more recent
# The path must be inside the context of the build; you cannot ADD ../something/something,

# CMD is the command the container executes by default when you launch the built image. A Dockerfile will only use the final CMD defined
# Sets default parameters that can be overridden from the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) when a container is running.

# ENTRYPOINT and CMD are appended so CMD can be used as arguments to ENTRYPOINT.
